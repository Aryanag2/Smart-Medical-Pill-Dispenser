4. Assign preliminary next-step tasks

| Idea | Problem Addressed | Key Features of the Project | Drawbacks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Smart Medical Pill Dispenser | Medication non-adherence in outpatient care | \- RFID-tagged bins for dose verification \- BLE to sync with phone / caregiver dashboard \- Weight sensor \+ HX711 for fill-level |  \- FDA / IEC-60601 compliance scope?  \- Battery life vs. Wi-Fi? |
| Smart Massage Sleeve for Athletes | Localized muscle fatigue & minor strains | \- IR thermography patch to find “hot spots” \- Pneumatic or vibro-motor arrays for massage \- Companion app tracks recovery heat maps |  \- Real-time thermal processing on-edge?  \- Sleeve bulk & user comfort during play |
| Assistive Object-Detection Glasses | Orientation cues for partially blind users | \- Stereo camera → onboard ML detection \- Bone-conduction audio for object call-outs \- Micro-LED spot in lens indicates sound origin |  \- Displaying light without glare / distraction  \- Latency of vision → audio → haptic loop |

*Smart Medical Pill Dispenser* edged out as the current front-runner, but we’ll keep all three alive until after discussing this with the TA and posting these on the web board as projects
