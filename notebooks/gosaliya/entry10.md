### Entry 10: April 20, 2025

**Objectives:**
- Test breadboard setup in machine shop environment  
- Integrate enclosure with buttons and LEDs  
- Prototype 3D-printed trimmer parts to prevent pill jamming  

**Record (Right-Hand Page):**
- Brought breadboard prototype to machine shop for fit check in enclosure  
- Mounted LEDs for dose status and pushbuttons for pairing/refill alerts  
- Observed pill jams in rotating gate design; designed “trimmer” guides to smooth flow  
- Sent trimmer models to SCD for 3D printing in PETG to test clearances  
- Verified button actuation and LED visibility through enclosure cutouts  
- Created logo or ADAPT ( Adi/Aryan Dispenser Advanced Pill Technology) on CANVA
