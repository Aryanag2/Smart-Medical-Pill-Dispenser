## Personal Thoughts
Switched to a USB to UART bridge that we can get from self help drawers and easier to solder. Worried about finishing PCB on time, mainly due to delivery delays. Just ordered another round of PCBs on our own dime as well. Wiring and schematics make sense, so atleast we are going faster in that regard now.
