# Smart Medical Pill Dispenser (SMPD)

## Overview
The **Smart Medical Pill Dispenser (SMPD)** is an automated, cost-effective device designed to help users manage their medications efficiently. The system automatically sorts, stores, and dispenses pills at scheduled times while providing refill alerts and adherence notifications. The project is designed to minimize user dependency on manual sorting and reduce medication errors.

## Features
- **Automated Sorting & Dispensing**: Pills are sorted into dedicated compartments and dispensed at user-defined schedules.
- **Offline Operation**: Requires WiFi only for initial setup and updates; Bluetooth support enables configuration without constant internet access.
- **Refill & Adherence Alerts**: LED indicators and a web app notify users about missed doses and low stock.
- **Battery Backup**: Ensures continued operation during power outages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based UI for configuration and monitoring.

## System Components
- **Microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32)**: Handles scheduling, dispensing, and user notifications.
- **RTC Module**: Maintains accurate time, even during power failures.
- **Stepper Motors & Rotating Disk**: Facilitates pill sorting and controlled dispensing.
- **Weight Sensor (HX711 Load Cell)**: Tracks remaining pill stock and prevents over-dispensing.
- **3D Printed Enclosure**: Built with food-safe PLA/PETG for safe storage and dispensing.
